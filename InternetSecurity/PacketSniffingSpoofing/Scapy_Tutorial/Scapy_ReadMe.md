# Scapy:
Scapy is a python program that enables the user to send, sniff, dissect and forge network packets. This capability allows construction of tools that cn probe, scan or attack networks. Scapy can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit testing, attacks or network discovery. It can replace hping, arpspoof, arping, p0f, and even some parts of Nmap, tcpdump, and tshark. 

Scapy can also handle other tasks that most other programs cannot handle, like sending invalid frames, injecting 802.11 frames, combining techniques (VLAN hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted channel...) etc.

VLAN: A VLAN (Virtual LAN) abstracts the idea of the local area network by providing data link connectivity for a subnet.
